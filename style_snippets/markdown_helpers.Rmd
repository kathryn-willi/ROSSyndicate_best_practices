## Automatic text wrapping

Use this code chunk to force consistent text wrapping in your document. Using
this is recommended so that the markdown document is readable on GitHub with
out manually adding lines. Best practice is to add this to the bottom of your
Rmd file and run it before you commit the file. You may have to run it twice,
it's a little finicky.

Note, this will not wrap text that are prefaced by any special characters (like
bullets, unless you use the 'insert bullet' function at the top of the Visual
editor). It also will not wrap text in a code chunk. You have to manually do
that.


```{r, echo = F}
knitr::wrap_rmd('style_snippets/markdown_helpers.Rmd', width = 80, backup = NULL)
```
