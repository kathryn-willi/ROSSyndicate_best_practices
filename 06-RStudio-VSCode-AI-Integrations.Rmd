# Using AI Integrations

In the ROSSyndicate, we are actively trying to use some of the large language
models to make our jobs easier/more efficient. Below is one of the most
sustainable ways to integrate the CoPilot LLM into your workflow.

We encourage all members of the lab to sign up for (and use!) any of the
following sites:

-   [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

-   GitHub CoPilot

-   [Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/)

## Using GitHub CoPilot in VSCode + RStudio

VSCode also has an extension for GitHub CoPilot, it will auto complete your
comments and code in nearly any programming language. By having open both VSCode
and RStudio and enabling auto-save in both programs, you can hop between the two
programs and code will update between the two as you switch. Big thanks to Sam
Struthers for figuring out this integrated workflow.

## Accessing GitHub CoPilot as a student/teacher/researcher

Access to GitHub CoPilot is currently free to students/teachers/researchers.
Follow the instructions here to submit an application to gain access to the
program: <https://education.github.com/discount_requests/pack_application>. A
screenshot of your 'employee information' from the [human resources
portal](https://aar.is.colostate.edu/service/hrprod) will be sufficient
information to verify your employment. GitHub usually will give you access to
the educational portal within 1 business day.

## Downloading VSCode and installing the GitHub CoPilot extension

Download VSCode here: <https://code.visualstudio.com/>. Set up the GitHub and
GitHub CoPilot extensions by adding them via the 'Marketplace'. You can bring up
the Extensions from the menu bar under 'Code', 'Settings', 'Extensions'.

You'll want to install and activate 'GitHub Pull Requests and Issues' as well as
'GitHub Copilot'. You will be directed to Sign In using your GitHub credentials.
You may need to elect to 'enable' Copilot.

## Setting up AutoSave in VSCode + RStudio

In RStudio, open the Preferences pane from the menu bar under 'RStudio', then
find the following pane:

Set up Auto-save by checking the 'Automatically save when editor loses focus' and 'Apply'.

In VSCode, select 'Code', 'Settings', then 'Settings' again from the menu bar to
bring up the Settings tab in your console. Then type in 'auto save' in the top
search bar, and select 'onFocusChange' for the 'Files: Auto Save' Setting.

Now you can switch between programs, using VSCode and CoPilot to draft code and
comment chunks, then further editing/running in RStudio.

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::wrap_rmd('06-RStudio-VSCode-AI-Integrations.Rmd', width = 80, backup = NULL)
#note, this will not wrap text that are prefaced by any special characters (like bullets!)
```
