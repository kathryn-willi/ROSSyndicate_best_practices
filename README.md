# ROSSyndicate style guide

ROSSyndicate style guide repository. A one-stop shop for the lab's coding best practices.

In general, we follow [the {tidyverse} style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). We use the {styler} Addin in RStudio to assist in linting our code. See the ROSS Lab Workflow Guide for details on installing and using this formatting method.
