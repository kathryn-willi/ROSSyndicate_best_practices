This means deploying understandable code and repositories that are accompanied by narrative comments and text. We value transparency in our analyses and believe that well documented repositories and code facilitate that. All code and software are licensed with the MIT use license. While we believe that all code and software should be public, we acknowledge that other researchers may wish to keep any code derived from ours private due to institutional barriers including but not limited to racism, sexism, and homophobia. GitHub contributions follow the ‘fork’ methodology that is common in most open science repositories (as opposed to the ‘branch’ method). All GitHub contributions are reviewed before being incorporated into the lab organization repository, except upon initial repository set up. These reviews are completed internally through pull requests. We value ‘bite-sized’ pull requests that usually only contain 500 lines of code. No code is formally published unless it has been consistently and intentionally reviewed. We make an effort to include external review of our repositories prior to formal publishing. We follow the {tidyverse} style guide. We use the {styler} Addin in RStudio to assist in linting our code. We use a set of common styles specific to the look and feel of rendered documents, which include: color palettes, ggthemes, and style.css files. These are meant to reduce the amount of time that researchers in this lab spend on relatively inconsequential decisions. The use of these aesthetics also creates a common look and feel of all deliverables from the ROSSyndicate. 1.2 Contents This best practices guide serves as an introduction to Git and GitHub, the lab’s style and code philosophies, and the tools we use for project management. 1.3 A living document The workflow best practices document is a living document and all members of the ROSSyndicate are welcome to submit edits to it via pull request. 1.4 Origin Adapted from the Geospatial Centroid’s GitHub Workflow Document, Caitlin Mothes, built out for ROSSyndicate by Katie Willi, B Steele, and Matt Brousil.
