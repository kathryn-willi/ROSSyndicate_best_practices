# Publishing Repositories

When delivering code or repositories to our stakeholders or other researchers,
it needs to be citable. A citable repository has a stable DOI (digital object
identifier) and complete metadata. We use the GitHub integration in Zenodo to
publish repositories. When set up correctly, a GitHub 'release' will push all
code to Zenodo automatically. All future 'releases' will be associated with the
original DOI as well as a new DOI specific to that release.

In general, the GitHub -\> Zenodo pathway is best for software (code) and not
necessarily for data. Data publishing should be completed at EDI, CUAHSI, or
FigShare. Derived data is okay in the GitHub -\> Zenodo pathway, just remember,
this pathway is meant to be for CODE and SOFTWARE, not necessarily for data
(though you can publish data to Zenodo).

As mentioned before, we only publish repositories that have been consistently
reviewed internally. Ideally your repository has been reviewed by an external
collaborator or by another ROSSyndicate member. Remember, by pushing this
repository to Zenodo, you are creating a PERMANENT archive of its contents, for
better or worse.

## Creating a Zenodo account

The easiest way to create a Zenodo account is to do so with your GitHub
credentials. You will need to link these two accounts in order to fully take
advantage of the GitHub/Zenodo integration.

## Preparing to publish

In order to have a meaningful repository release, you need to provide some
metadata to Zenodo. While there are no requirements for publishing to Zenodo,
it is a best practice to include robust metadata alongside your code release. A
metadata template can be found in the helpful_docs folder of this repository.

Once you've compiled this information, send it to Katie Willi or Anika Pyle for
proofreading.

### Release Title

You can use the repository name, but that's not going to be helpful for anyone
except you! Someone reading the Release Title should be able to discern what
the repository does. You can explain the 'how' in the description.

### Author list

Prepare your author list by looking at the contributors to the repo. All
contributors to the repo should be listed as an author. You will need each
author's full name, institution, and their [ORCID](https://orcid.org/).

### Description

This is the big lift in creating the metadata. Consider this similar to the
introduction/background and methods section of a scientific paper. In the
description of your repository, add information about the following things:

-   General code description - the 'how' of your repository

-   Methodology (summary only) - specifically if there are multiple steps to an analysis it is helpful to provide a methodology. If the repository hosts a very complicated analysis, consider only a condensed version of methods here, but add a markdown document with the complete methodology in your repository.

-   If you are including data:

    -   data lineage (aka, where the data came from)

    -   explanation of how the data have been manipulated if they are derived (this is related to methods, so use your best judgement).

-   If the analysis is specific to a certain locale, state and describe the locale.

-   Maintenance and maintenance interval. 'Ongoing' or 'completed'. If 'ongoing', state the approximate interval that the repository will be updated.

-   If this is an update to a previous release, state the changes from the previous version.

Generally speaking, much of this information should already exist in your
repository README or Methods document and cutting/pasting is absolutely okay.
This section may be lengthy and that is okay!

### Version

For one-time releases (like preparing a repository for a paper), using a
version-number is perfect (i.e. v1, v2, etc). For repositories that are updated
frequently, consider using a version-year-number (i.e. v2022-1, v2023-1,
v2023-2, etc).

### Keywords

Generally speaking, keywords help others find your code or research. It is not
required. Keywords should be meaningful and specific and can include places,
methods, etc. It is common to use controlled vocabulary for keywords, like the
[LTER controlled vocabulary for ecology
research](https://vocab.lternet.edu/vocab/vocab/index.php).

### License

All repositories that are published are considered open access. Because our
repository best practices include using an MIT use license, the LICENSE.txt
file will override this option.

### Funding

If there is applicable funding sources for this repository, you should list
them. You will need the funder name and the grant number.

**No other fields are required.**

## Linking a repository to Zenodo

To activate the GitHub/Zenodo integration for a given repository, navigate to
the GitHub account page by clicking the dropdown menu in the top right of the
window.

From here, you simply follow the directions!

## Completing the metadata information

To complete the entry of your metadata information and formalize the publishing
of your repository, you'll need to edit the Zenodo upload. Do this by
navigating to the 'Upload' section of Zenodo (by clicking 'Upload' at the top
of the Zenodo site).

Here, you can click on the released repository:

And then click the 'Edit' button:

![](images/Screenshot%202023-06-28%20at%202.39.53%20PM.png)

Here, you can enter in all information from your Zenodo metadata document. When
you're ready, press 'Save' and then 'Publish'.

### Add the DOI badge to your repository

Now that you've minted a sweet sweet DOI for your repository, you should go
ahead and add the DOI badge to your repository's README file.

On the right hand side of your Zenodo release landing page (formatted as
'<https://zenodo.org/record/*DOInumber>\*' on your browser), click on the DOI
badge:

![](images/Screenshot%202023-06-28%20at%202.43.40%20PM.png){width="200"}

This will pop up a number of embedding formats. Copy and paste the one for
'Markdown'. At this point, go to the GitHub repository and add the badge at the
top of the primary README file within the GitHub user interface on the web.
This addition to the repository does not need to be reviewed.

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::wrap_rmd('07-Publishing-Repositories.Rmd', width = 80, backup = NULL)
#note, this will not wrap text that are prefaced by any special characters (like bullets!)
```
